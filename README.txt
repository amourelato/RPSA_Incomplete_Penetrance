This repository contains the analyses performed for the study "Both mutant and wild-type alleles drive the penetrance of haploinsufficiency in human heterozygotes":

This repository can be cloned with: git clone https://github.com/amourelato/RPSA_Incomplete_Penetrance

This repository contains two workflows

WT_RPSA_Analysis: Identification of WT RPSA haplotype sequence and hamming distance calculations, sibship analysis, grouping WT RPSA haplotypes, IBS analysis, and block-resampling calculations

RPSA_eQTL_Fine_Mapping: Fine-mapping and allele fold change analysis using GTEx v8 data.

Each workflow has its own README describing:
Purpose and structure
Data directories and subdirectories
Script descriptions and dependencies
Results structure


Please refer to the README inside each workflow subdirectory for details on:
Data access
Script execution order
Data availability

-Some data required for these analyses are not located in this repository, as they are private/controlled-access, or larger than GitHub size restrictions. 
-Instructions to request data access or to obtain publicly available data that exceeded size restrictions are provided in each workflowâ€™s README.
